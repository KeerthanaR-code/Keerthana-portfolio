## ðŸš€ Featured Projects  

### 1. Agricultural UAV Systems (ArduPilot & PX4)  

<table style="border: none;">
<tr>
<td style="width:50%; vertical-align:center; padding-right:15px;">
- Developed and tuned PID control algorithms in simulation environments using MATLAB/Simulink, ArduPilot SITL and PX4-ROS Gazebo plugins. <br>
- Worked extensively with Mission Planner (ArduPilot) and QGroundControl (PX4) for mission planning, UAV calibration, and flight testing. <br>
- Led end-to-end system testing, including system architecture design, control logic implementation, real-time sensor data processing, and actuator response tuning.

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width:50%; vertical-align:top; padding-right:15px;">
- Built and tested autonomous obstacle avoidance algorithms: <br>
    - Prototyped on a modified RC car platform for safe ground-based stereo-camera testing. Worked with OpenCV for real-time processing of stereo camera feeds. <br>
    - Successfully transitioned to UAV platforms for real-world deployment. <br>
- Designed and integrated a computer vision system using Intel RealSense D435 and OpenCV on Raspberry Pi, enabling depth-based obstacle detection and YOLO-based people detection from onboard RGB feeds. <br>
- Trained, validated and tested custom YOLO models for object detection and tracking for real-time monitoring from UAV.
